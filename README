django mini-project
===================

Requirements
------------
1.
    a. allow users to register (collect username, email, password)
    b. users can login
    c. upon logging in, users have the option to Facebook Connect
    d. upon connecting with Facebook, show list of friends (name/photo)
    e. if Facebook Connected at login, show friends list (name/photo)
    f. use PostgreSQL as the backend database (default port)
    g. user password is encrypted using SHA1

2. use git

3. use virtualenv and pip to manage dependencies

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repo using the following command:
     git clone git@github.com:ajayravindra/django-sample.git

2. Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
     virtualenv --no-site-packages <myenv>

3. Use pip to install all the required dependencies in the virtual environment:
     pip install -E myenv -r django-sample/pen2/requirements.txt

4. Set up the PostgreSQL database:
     createdb <database_name>
     createuser <username> -s <role> -W  ## you will be prompted to enter passwd
     # update above values in django-sample/pen2/settings.py

5. Switch to the virtual environment:
     source myenv/bin/activate 

6. Migrate the Django database and start the server:
     cd django-sample/pen2
     python manage.py syncdb
     python manage.py runserver

7. Facebook does not allow callbacks to localhost or 127.0.0.1. In order to
   test this app on localhost, please add an alias route in /etc/hosts like so:

     127.0.0.1 fstestapp.com

   If you choose a name other than 'fstestapp.com', please also update the new
   name in pen2/settings.py (variable: LOCALHOST_ALIAS)

Known Issues
------------
1. If multiple users login with different usernames, but connect to the same
   Facebook account, friends list will only be shown for the first account.
     => ideally, I should disallow such connections in the backend, but we're
        just playing here, right?

2. I have disabled email authorization of the account. Hence, upon successful
   account registration, you will NOT receive an email (although the user
   message says it has sent you an email. You can just go ahead and login.
